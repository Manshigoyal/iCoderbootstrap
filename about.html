                <p class="lead">Python, known for its simplicity and versatility, is one of the most popular programming
                    languages today. From developing dynamic web applications to driving machine learning algorithms and
                    handling complex data analytics. Most of the tech giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and
                    Instagram rely on Python to build and maintain their cutting-edge technology solutions.

                    Now, whether you’re a beginner looking to write your first Python program or an experienced
                    developer exploring advanced Python features, this Python tutorial is tailored to guide you through
                    every step of your Python journey!.</p>

                <h1>First Python Program to Learn Python Programming</h1>
                There are two ways you can execute your Python program:
                <p>1] First, we write a program in a file and run it one time.</p>
                <p>2] Second, run a code line by line.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Python was created by Guido van Rossum. In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum, a Dutch
                        programmer, began working on Python while at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
                        Netherlands. He wanted to create a successor to the ABC programming language that would be easy
                        to read and efficient.

                        In February 1991, the first public version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released. This marked
                        the official birth of Python as an open-source project. The language was named after the British
                        comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".                      
                    </p>

                    <p> Python development has gone through several stages. In January 1994, Python 1.0 was released as
                        a usable and stable programming language. This version included many of the features that are
                        still present in Python today.

                        From the 1990s to the 2000s, Python gained popularity for its simplicity, readability, and
                        versatility. In October 2000, Python 2.0 was released. Python 2.0 introduced list
                        comprehensions, garbage collection, and support for Unicode.

                        In December 2008, Python 3.0 was released. Python 3.0 introduced several backward-incompatible
                        changes to improve code readability and maintainability.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Features in Python
                            In this section we will see what are the features of Python programming language:

                        <h2>1. Free and Open Source</h2>
                        Python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the
                        given download link below click on the Download Python keyword. Download Python Since it is
                        open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can
                        download it, use it as well as share it.

                        <h2> 2. Easy to code</h2>
                        Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as
                        compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in
                        the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a
                        developer-friendly language.

                        <h2></h2>3. Easy to Read</h2>
                        As you will see, learning Python is quite simple. As was already established, Python’s
                        syntax is really straightforward. The code block is defined by the indentations rather than
                        by semicolons or brackets.

                        <h2> 4. Object-Oriented Language</h2>
                        One of the key features of Python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports
                        object-oriented language and concepts of classes, object encapsulation, etc.

                        <h2>5. GUI Programming Support</h2>
                        Graphical User interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython, or Tk
                        in Python. PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.
